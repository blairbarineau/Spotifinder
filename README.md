# Spotifinder
The purpose behind Spotifinder was to create a way for users to easily discover and obtain music they may like. Our web application addresses three main issues:
Without effort, and a bit of luck, it can be difficult to discover music that you like. Spotifinder allows users to enter a variety of inputs such as a song, artist, album or playlist they like; or numerical parameters about the type of music they like such as danceability, energy or tempo. From there, the web application returns songs, artists, albums, or playlists that the user is likely to enjoy based on their input.
Going through oneâ€™s music library, or thinking about what songs to add, in order to create a playlist, can be a time consuming process. Based on the aforementioned inputs, Spotifinder uses data on Spotify playlists to display pre-made playlists that the user is likely to be interested in.
As streaming platforms become one of the primary ways for artists and record labels to promote their music, recommendations on these platforms become increasingly influenced by paid partnerships, in turn lowering the quality of suggestions for users. Spotifinder simply uses numerical data values such as tempo, energy, valence and danceability to suggest music that is solely based on user input and nothing else.
